# Transfer-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Final project for the COMP-767 Reinforcement Learning course at McGill University

## Setup and Installation
1. Run `bash setup.sh` to create the directories necessary to store experiment results
2. Install pip dependencies with `pip install -r req.txt`

## Run Experiments
All source code is made available in Jupyter Notebooks, so that plots may be visualized.<br>
1. DQN CartPole experiments are available in `dqn_cart.ipynb`
2. DQN LunarLander experiments are available in `dqn_lander.ipynb`
3. DDPG ContinuousCartPole experiments are available in `ddpg_cart.ipynb`
4. DDPG LunarLanderContinuous experiments are available in `ddpg_lander.ipynb`
5. REINFORCE CartPole and LunarLander experiments are available in `reinforce_cart+lander.ipynb`
